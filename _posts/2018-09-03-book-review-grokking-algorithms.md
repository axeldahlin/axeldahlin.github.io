Learning about and solving problems with the help of algorithms is hard. Especially when you are a complete newbie. When I was in that situation I just wanted someone to take my hand and walk me through these new concepts from start to finish. This is what Grokking Algorithms is all about.

This book explains different sort, graph and search algorithms. And it does this with the help of really cool illustrations . It also discusses and explains performance trade-offs between different algorithms.

**The chapters of the book are:**

* Introduction to algorithms
* Selection sort
* Recursion
* Quicksort
* Hash tables
* Breadth-first search
* Dijkstra’s algorithm
* Greedy algorithms
* Dynamic programming
* K-nearest neighbors
* Where to go next

When a new concept is introduced the author breaks it down and walk the reader through the solution. Aditya does this really good and combined with the illustrations the learning experience is great.

The author also puts everything in context.  In the example of Dijkstra's algorithm a person wants to trade a book for a piano. There is six persons that all want to sell things for different prices.  To get the piano the person have to buy and sell things from the other people. Different choices, or paths,  will have different monetary outcomes. This illustrates the problem (and solution) of finding the cheapest path in a graph in a great way.


The book is filled with code examples too. They are written i Python but with the help  of google even a JavaScript person like myself can understand them. But if you just want to have the code in JavaScript Aditya have a GitHub repo with examples of the code in different languages, including JavaScript.

In the last chapter 10 more algorithms is presented briefly with the intent to get the reader an idea of where to go next. I think that was a great way of ending the book and it got me excited about all the solutions and approaches to problems that are out there.

I do not even have anything bad to say about this book. For some one who just started learning about algorithms this is a book that is both great for learning and fun to work with. I am guessing that more experienced people would find the read enjoyable even if the subjects are already known to them.

Before reading this book I found the challenges on sites like Codesignal and CodeWars really tough. But afterwards when I knew how to picture the problems and break them down I started to take them on with a newly found confidence. And soon enough I got up to speed and started to solve more and more challenges. I solid proof of that this book kick starts the part of the brain that deals with logic and problem solving.

This book will not make you an expert in algorithms. But it will give you a place to start, give you the basics and last but not least an really enjoyable read.
