To be a better developer it is crucial to build things. Then some more things. And after that more things! But in the beginning it can be hard to know what to actually build. So here is 10 tips on projects to build with vanilla JavaScript:

# 1 - To Do List
Good first project. Not super exciting but a useful one because we all got stuff to do! To make it a bit more challenging it possible to implement localStorage to save the list.

# 2 - Book Marker Application
A book marker application where the user can save links to websites by copying the URL of the site in one text-input and write desired name for the site in another text-input. This app can also make use of localStorage. It is possible to play around with some functionalities like:

* form validation
* use regular expression to check if the URL the user provides startes with "http" or "https".

# 3 - JavaScript Clock
Even though not all apps displays the time many apps  some how use a counter which depends on a Date instance. A clock application can there for be a good way of getting to know the Date instance.

# 4 - Pomodoro Timer
Well, as I just said - a Date instance is pretty useful when building a Pomodoro timer. A like to use a pomodoro to keep track of my coding and it is even more fun to do it with your own Pomodoro application.

# 5 - Funny Sounds Page


An application where the user can play different sounds my submitting forms, press keys and click on elements. You can come up with other things than only sounds of course, in the one I built the background changed to an image of an monster at the same time as a horror-like sound was playing when the user clicked on the question mark. Here you get to practice:

* event-listeners on both clicks and key downs
* forms
* play sound
* animation

And anything else you can come up with really!

# 6 - Memory Game
A memory game that makes use of the dataset property to save the value of the card so that we can check if the user have clicked on a card pair. I saw that FCC have a tutorial on Youtube in how to write a memory game that looks really good so it can be worth to check that out!

# 7 - Random Quote Generator
There is lots of tutorials on this one out there. It is a good projects for beginners.

# 8 - Calculator
As always when it comes to development there is many ways to solve the same problem. It is the same with a calculator. I checked out multiple tutorials and all of them had very different approaches to code structure and ways to solve this problem. The tutorial with a structure of the logic that made the most sense to me was one that used jQuery. I followed the tutorial but used vanilla JavaScript instead. The tutorial is made by Dylan Israel for FCC and you can find it here.

# 9 - Mouse Over Canvas Play
Mouse-over effects is used in almost every website, so we might as well have some fun with it! This project makes use of the Canvas element that is used for drawing with JavaScript. To draw different shapes you have to do some calculations with geometry which is pretty fun. And with it you can create some really beautiful visuals for the web. [To get started with canvas a recommend this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO6OkltgudE). It is really great!

# 10 - Drawing program
This projects also uses canvas. It is really much simpler than it seams, if you first do the mouse-over project with the help of the tutorial I linked, this one will be a piece of cake! You can of course make it as complex as you want want with different tools like pencils and brushes, ways to pick colors and other styling.

When I was a kid I used Paint to draw stuff. So it is a really cool feeling to be able to write a similar program my self.
