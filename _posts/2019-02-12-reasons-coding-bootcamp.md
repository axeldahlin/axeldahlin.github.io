In recent years the popularity of coding bootcamps have increased a lot. And for good reason. It have been proven to be great way for changing your career and become a developer. But I found that there are more personal things to gain. Here are 7 reasons to enroll in a coding bootcamp - that has nothing (almost) to do with your career. 

## 1. Challenge your self

A coding bootcamp is by definition hard. The curriculum is intense and the problems you are faced with are complicated. So it's the perfect opportunity to challenge yourself. You will know exactly how hard you can work and how complicated problems you are able to solve. And looking back on your accomplishments will feel great!

## 2. Total focus on what you love

Before I joined the bootcamp I was coding after work. I was coding before work. I was sometimes coding while commuting to work. But in the end, a huge chunk of my day was spent on a job that had nothing to do with programming. So it was really amazing when I started the bootcamp and could focus on coding completely. And now that I work as a teacher assistant at Ironhack I work with code all day. It's a dream that came true.

## 3. Learn how to learn new things fast

The pace of the course is fast. But the curriculum is designed so it's possible to learn a lot in nine weeks. After the bootcamp you are equipped with strategies on how to learn new technologies really fast. I feel that I can learn anything now. Maybe I should use this new super power to learn to play the piano?

## 4. Meet other people that love coding

Before I knew exactly one person that was a coder. When joined the bootcamp I suddenly knew 26! It was great to have people to learn from and get inspired by. And so cool to share tips and tricks on how to code in smarter ways. It was so much fun to hang out and build projects together. It's very important to share your passion and goals with others.

## 5. Learn faster that anybody else

During the bootcamp you will learn as much as possible. As much as it humanly possible, actually. That means that you are learning faster than any body else in the world. Other people that are doing the bootcamp may be learning just as fast as you. But nobody is learning faster. I know, it's not a competition. But it's still pretty mind-boggling. 

## 6. Network all over the world

Depends on your bootcamp of course, but my bootcamp have campuses in several countries all over the world. That means that it's easy for me to find interesting talks and meetups while traveling. Former alumni can probably give recommendations for places to eat, drink and other fun stuff as well. 

## 7. Live in a new city or country

You have to save money to cover the living expenses during the bootcamp and while looking for a job afterwards. It's similar to changing country or city. Then it's also important to save some money for the first time in the new location. So it's the perfect situation for doing both at the same time! It's more exciting to learn new things in a new and exciting place.
